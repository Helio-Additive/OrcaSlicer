<br>Orca Slicer is an open source slicer for FDM printers. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that this is a a customized fork of Orca Slicer with **cloud-based thermal simulation** built right in.

This version adds Helio‚Äôs physics-driven thermal simulation directly into your slicing workflow. Instantly visualize layer-by-layer thermal behavior and optimize for print reliability;  no extra software needed.

## üöÄ Added Helio Additive Features

### üî• Thermal Simulation Integration
- Slice as usual or toggle on **"Slice with Helio"** to generate a full thermal simulation of your print.
- View **layer time dependent temperature** directly in the **Preview panel**, alongside standard slicer settings.
- Get insight into thermal consistency, cooling behavior, and critical hotspots in your model.

### üåê Cloud-Based Processing
- Simulation is offloaded to the cloud for fast processing ‚Äì no local compute needed.
- Requires internet connection and a personal api key for usage.
- Simulations are offered for free

### üß™ Experimental Features
- Integrated thermal overlays in the Preview tab.
- Thermal results viewable layer by layer, road by road or across the full print.

## Wiki
The wiki below aims to provide a detailed introduction to and support for **Orca Slicer, Helio Edition**.

Please note that the wiki is a work in progress. We appreciate your patience as we continue to develop and improve it!

## Download Helio Additive's Orca Slicer Version

Download our customized version of OrcaSlicer with **cloud-based thermal simulation** built in.

### Stable Release
üì• **[Download the Latest Stable Release](https://github.com/Helio-Additive/OrcaSlicer/releases)**  
Visit our GitHub Releases page for the latest stable version of Orca Slicer, recommended for most users.

## How to set up

üìù **[View Our Guide On Setting Up Supported Printer And Material Profiles](https://docs.helioadditive.com/en/slicers/orcaslicer/#initial-set-up)** 

## How to use
1. Slice your model as usual.
2. Enable **‚ÄúSlice with Helio‚Äù** before slicing.
3. Once slicing and simulation completes, view the thermal results in the Preview panel.
4. You can toggle between regular preview parameters and thermal simulation overlays.

For more information on reading and improving results, refer to our [documentation here](https://docs.helioadditive.com/en/slicers/orcaslicer/#how-to-interpret-thermal-index). 

## Note (from the Original Orca Slicer Project): 
If you're running Klipper, it's recommended to add the following configuration to your `printer.cfg` file.
```
# Enable object exclusion
[exclude_object]

# Enable arcs support
[gcode_arcs]
resolution: 0.1
```

# Supports
**Orca Slicer** is an open-source project and I'm deeply grateful to all my sponsors and backers.   
Their generous support enables me to purchase filaments and other essential 3D printing materials for the project.   
Thank you! :)
